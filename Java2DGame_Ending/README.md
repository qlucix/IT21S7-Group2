# Creating an Open World game: “Dungeons & Wagons” using Java (FINAL VERSION)

This repository contains a Role PLaying Game project which aims to give the user the ability to create, personalize, and customize their own character in a fantasy setting. The system is a game application which gives a visual representation of the characters and maps. Built along with their corresponding class, subclass, attributes, unique traits, and a captivating backstory made by the user, they are given the freedom to create and manifest their fantasy self before embarking on an adventure.

## Project Overview

This Java 2D game project is aimed at helping me learn game development using Java. I followed along with the tutorial by Ryisnow to create this game. While the code is not yet finished, I've decided to share it here as a way to track my progress and share what I've learned.
