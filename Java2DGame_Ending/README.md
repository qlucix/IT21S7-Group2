In partial fulfillment of the requirements in
CS 201 Data Structures and Algorithm 

This repository contains a Role PLaying Game project which aims to give the user the ability to create, personalize, and customize their own character in a fantasy setting. The system is a game application which gives a visual representation of the characters and maps. Built along with their corresponding class, subclass, attributes, unique traits, and a captivating backstory made by the user, they are given the freedom to create and manifest their fantasy self before embarking on an adventure.

## Project Overview
