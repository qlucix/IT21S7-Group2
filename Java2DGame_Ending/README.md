# Java 2D Game Project (Work in Progress)

This repository contains a Java 2D game project that I've been working on, inspired by a tutorial from Ryisnow on YouTube. Please note that this project is a work in progress, and I'm sharing it to keep my GitHub account active and to potentially inspire others who are interested in game development.

## Project Overview

This Java 2D game project is aimed at helping me learn game development using Java. I followed along with the tutorial by Ryisnow to create this game. While the code is not yet finished, I've decided to share it here as a way to track my progress and share what I've learned.

## Getting Started

To run this game on your local machine, you will need:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have Java installed. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.

2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: You can use any Java-compatible IDE, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code.

3. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/auriorajaa/Java2DGame.git
   ```

4. **Open the Project**: Open the project in your chosen IDE.

5. **Run the Game**: Run the game's main class to start the game. Please note that since this is a work in progress, there may be incomplete or buggy features.

## Issues and Feedback

If you encounter any issues while running the game or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue on this repository. Your feedback is valuable, and it may help me enhance the project.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to Ryisnow for creating the tutorial that inspired this project. Learning from others' work is a valuable way to grow as a developer, and I hope this project can inspire others in the same way.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository, and I hope you find this project interesting!
